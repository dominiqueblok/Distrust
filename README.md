This is the distrust lexicon and dataset mentioned in the paper 'Automatically detecting distrust on social media' by Dominique Blok, Julia Broderick-Hale, Thom van Gessel, Gino Kalkman, and Valentina Maccatrozzo.

We included some words that are specific to COVID-19 and the surrounding culture to the lexicon because the dataset contains messages from the COVID period. These words can be omitted for a more general use of the distrust lexicon.
